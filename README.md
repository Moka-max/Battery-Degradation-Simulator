# Battery Capacity Degradation Simulator

A terminal-based Python application that simulates battery capacity degradation over charge cycles using polynomial regression.

## Features

- Choose battery type: Li-ion, Solid State, LFP
- Set operating temperature and charging rate
- Predict capacity after given charge cycles
- Visualize degradation curve with matplotlib (no browser needed)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Usage

```bash
python battery_sim.py
